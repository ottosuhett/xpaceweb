# Xpace Project

Xpace is a responsive web application inspired by SpaceX. 
It is built using HTML, Sass, Bootstrap and  AOS library for animation effects. 
The goal of this project was to practice responsive design using Bootstrap and Sass to create a visually appealing application.

## Features

Xpace has a number of features, including:
- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
- A clean and modern UI inspired by the design of SpaceX.
- The use of the Bootstrap framework for a consistent and user-friendly experience.
- Animation effects provided by the AOS library.
- Easy to navigate and user-friendly interface.

## Customization
Xpace is a highly customizable project. Users can modify the Sass styles, HTML structure, or even add additional functionality to create their own unique website.
Feel free to modify the project according to your needs. 

**I left the sass folder with the scss files that originated the css files to provide the possibility of customization using Sass.**

You can make changes to the Sass styles, HTML structure, or even add additional functionality to create your unique website.

To customize the Xpace project, you will need to clone the repository and compile the Sass styles. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/ottosuhett/xpaceweb.git`

If you want to customize the styles:

2. If you want to customize the styles, navigate to the project folder and open the sass directory. Modify the `.scss` files to make changes to the styles of the application.

3.If you have Node.js installed, you can run the following command in your terminal or command prompt to compile the updated styles:
`sass --watch sass/style.scss:style.css`

4. Use a live server extension to view the application in your browser.

If you don't have Node.js installed, you can follow these steps to install it:

1. Go to the Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and download the installer for your operating system.
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
